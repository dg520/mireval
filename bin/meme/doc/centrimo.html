    </div>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>
      <p>CentriMo takes a set of motifs and a set of equal-length DNA or RNA 
      sequences and plots the positional distribution of the best match of each motif. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The motifs are typically compendia of DNA- or RNA-binding motifs, and
      the sequences might be: 500 bp sequences aligned on ChIP-seq peaks or summits; 
      300 bp sequences centered on sets of transcription start sites or
      translation start sites; sequences aligned on splice-junctions; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
      CentriMo also computes the "local enrichment" of each motif by counting the
      number of times its best match in each sequence occurs in a local region
      and applying a statistical test to see if the local enrichment is signficant.
      By default, CentriMo examines only regions <b>centered</b>, in the input sequences,
      but CentriMo will compute the enrichment of <b>all</b> regions if you specify
      the <span class="popt">--local</span> option.
      CentriMo uses the binomial test to compute the
      significance of the number of sequences where the best match occurs in
      a given region, assuming a uniform prior over best match positions.
      CentriMo reports the location and significance of the best region for each motif.
      </p>
      <p>
      CentriMo can also perform comparative enrichment, reporting the relative
      enrichment of the best region in a second, control set of sequences if
      you specify the <span class="popt">--neg</span>.  CentriMo choses regions
      based on their significance in the primary set of sequences, and then
      it uses the Fisher exact test to evaluate the significance of the number 
      of best matches in the region in the primary set compared with the number 
      of best matches in the same region in the control set of sequences.

    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <h4>Motif File</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>A file containing motifs. Outputs from MEME and DREME are supported,
        as well as <a href=meme-format.html#min_format><b>minimal MEME format</b></a>. 
        You can convert many other motif formats to minimal MEME format
        using <a href="overview.html#conversion_utilities">conversion scripts</a>
        available with the MEME Suite.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Sequence File</h4>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>A file containing FASTA formatted sequences, ideally all of the
        same length.  The sequences in this file are referred to as the 
        "positive sequences" when a second set of sequences is provided using the 
        <span class="popt">--neg</span> option (see below).</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <div class="indent">
      <p>CentriMo outputs an HTML file that allows interactive selection of
      which motifs to plot the positional distribution for and control over
      smoothing and other plotting parameters.  CentriMo also
      outputs two text files: centrimo.txt, a tab delimited
      version of the results, and site_counts.txt, which lists, for each motif
      and each offset, the number of sequences where the best match of the motif
      occurs at the given offset.</p>
